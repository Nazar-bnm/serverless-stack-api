# Create an optimized package for our functions
# By default Serverless Framework creates a single package for all your Lambda functions.
# This means that when a Lambda function is invoked, itâ€™ll load all the code in your app.
# Including all the other Lambda functions. This negatively affects performance as your app grows in size.
# The larger your Lambda function packages, the longer the cold starts.
package:
  individually: true # Serverless Framework is packaging our functions individually, add the following to yourgit 

plugins:
  - serverless-bundle # Package our functions with Webpack
  - serverless-offline
  - serverless-dotenv-plugin # Load .env as environment variables

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs12.x
  stage: prod

  # These environment variables are made available to our functions
  # under process.env.

  # 'iamRoleStatements' defines the permission policy for the Lambda function.
  # In this case Lambda functions are granted with permissions to access DynamoDB.
